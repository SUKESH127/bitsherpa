Module 3 will be doing a bunch of relatively easy exercises on a great website - codingbat.com!

1) Go to codingbat.com and create an account

2) Go to the prefs tab and share your account with me by adding my email address (itâ€™s my first name last name ninety five at gmail)

3) Complete all the exercises in the Python section that have a 1-appended to them. After passing the tests, you can compare your solution for any exercise with the provided solutions (credit to faysalmehedi)
